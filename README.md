# Heart Disease Prediction

This 'Heart Disease Prediction' is a classification project I made during my Complete AI and ML Bootcamp by ZTM.

I completed this project along Daniel Bourke Sir and learnt a lot from it.

## Steps I followed:-

1. **Problem Definition** - Predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not.
2. **Data** - Downloaded and imported the data into a DataFrame.
3. **Evaluation** - Defined the evaluation metric i.e >95% accuracy score.
4. **Features** - Defined a data dictionary which defines what a feature means.

5. **Modelling** - This includes
   * Splitting data into features and labels
   * Splitting the features and labels into train and test splits
   * Choosing the right model/s
   * Instantiating a model
   * Fitting the model/s
   * Evaluating the model
   * Choosing the model with best performance
   * Hyperparameter tuning for better performance of model
   * Evaluation report at the end


After the features section, we import all the necessary libraries, get the data ready and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to learn more about the data.

## What I learnt from this project?

* I learnt how I should get ready to make an ML project.
* I learnt how to communicate better using markdowns in the notebooks.
* How to perform hyperparameter tuning
* How to evaluate my model using cross validation
* Also, how to google or use stack overflow in case you come across any error, which is one of the most important thing while making project.
and many more..

But these were the key takeaways while making this project.

I'm making new projects using this workflow I learnt and the workflow is not fixed and varies from person to person.
